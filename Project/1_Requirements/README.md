# Description
 
* ##  Basic working idea of induction stove
* The Induction Stove\cooktop consists of a surface( usually made of glass), under which  there is a coiled metal induction element. A magnetic field is created as electricity flows into the coils. Within this field the cookwares are placed, these ferromagnetic cookware functions as the second conductor, and a current is produced onto it.This generates the Eddy currents  within the cookware, which has its own magnetic field. This in turn opposes the induction element's currents. Energy produced by the opposing magnetic fields is released in the form of heat within the cookware (or vessel), due to this the contents in the cookware also gets heated.
* When the the powerbutton of induction stove is  switched ON, it should just blink untill a vessel is placed on it , Once the vessel is placed it should display the options like: Fry, Water, Milk, Pan etc. Once the user chooses the option it should show the heat reading. For some option there is fix heat reading and for some the usere can increase or decrease it. The temperature is also measured and displayed to user. There is also an option for timeer settings.

* Shall Detected  Vessel(whether placed on stove or not).
* Shall  Producing enough amount of heat to cook.
* Shall take the power from Switching circuit.

 
 ## Low Level Requirements
 * Shall display the user option on Led/lcd  Display.
 * Shall provide time changing option.
 * Shall provide Temperature changing option.
